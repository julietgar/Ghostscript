     * TODO
     *
     * -dCOLORSCREEN
     * -dCOLORSCREEN=0
     * -dCOLORSCREEN=false
     *     On high-resolution devices (at least 150 dpi resolution, or -dDITHERPPI specified), -dCOLORSCREEN forces the
     *     use of separate halftone screens with different angles for CMYK or RGB if halftones are needed (this
     *     produces the best-quality output); -dCOLORSCREEN=0 uses separate screens with the same frequency and angle;
     *     -dCOLORSCREEN=false forces the use of a single binary screen. The default if COLORSCREEN is not specified is
     *     to use separate screens with different angles if the device has fewer than 5 bits per color, and a single
     *     binary screen (which is never actually used under normal circumstances) on all other devices.
     *
     * -dDITHERPPI=lpi
     *     Forces all devices to be considered high-resolution, and forces use of a halftone screen or screens with lpi
     *     lines per inch, disregarding the actual device resolution. Reasonable values for lpi are N/5 to N/20, where
     *     N is the resolution in dots per inch.
     *
     * -dDOINTERPOLATE
     *     Turns on image interpolation for all images, improving image quality for scaled images at the expense of
     *     speed. Note that -dNOINTERPOLATE overrides -dDOINTERPOLATE if both are specified.
     *
     *     -dNOINTERPOLATE does nearest neighbour scaling (Bresenham's line algorithm through the image, plotting the
     *     closest texture coord at each pixel). If we are downscaling this results in some source pixels not appearing
     *     at all in the destination. If we are upscaling, at least some source pixels cover more than one destination
     *     pixel.
     *
     *     In all but special cases -dDOINTERPOLATE uses a Mitchell filter function to scale the contributions for each
     *     output pixel; upscaling, every output pixel ends up being the weighted sum of 16 input pixels, downscaling
     *     more. Every source pixel has an effect on the output pixels.
     *
     *     Computationally, -dDOINTERPOLATE is much heavier work than -dNOINTERPOLATE (lots of floating point muliplies
     *     and adds for every output pixel vs simple integer additions, subtractions, and shifts).
     *
     *     The exact algorithm used is from Graphics Gems 3, Chapter I.2 General Filtered Image Rescaling.
     *
     * -dTextAlphaBits=n
     * -dGraphicsAlphaBits=n
     *     These options control the use of subsample antialiasing. Their use is highly recommended for producing high
     *     quality rasterizations. The subsampling box size n should be 4 for optimum output, but smaller values can be
     *     used for faster rendering. Antialiasing is enabled separately for text and graphics content. Allowed values
     *     are 1, 2 or 4.
     *
     *     Note that because of the way antialiasing blends the edges of shapes into the background when they are drawn
     *     some files that rely on joining separate filled polygons together to cover an area may not render as
     *     expected with GraphicsAlphaBits at 2 or 4. If you encounter strange lines within solid areas, try rendering
     *     that file again with -dGraphicsAlphaBits=1.
     *
     * -dAlignToPixels=n
     *     Chooses glyph alignent to integral pixel boundaries (if set to the value 1) or to subpixels (value 0).
     *     Subpixels are a smaller raster grid which is used internally for text antialiasing. The number of subpixels
     *     in a pixel usually is 2^TextAlphaBits, but this may be automatically reduced for big characters to save
     *     space in character cache.
     *
     *     The parameter has no effect if -dTextAlphaBits=1. Default value is 0.
     *
     *     Setting -dAlignToPixels=0 can improve rendering of poorly hinted fonts, but may impair the appearance of
     *     well-hinted fonts.
     *
     * -dGridFitTT=n
     *     This specifies the initial value for the implementation specific user parameter GridFitTT. It controls grid
     *     fitting of True Type fonts (Sometimes referred to as "hinting", but strictly speaking the latter is a
     *     feature of Type 1 fonts). Setting this to 2 enables automatic grid fitting for True Type glyphs. The value 0
     *     disables grid fitting. The default value is 2. For more information see the description of the user
     *     parameter GridFitTT.
     *
     * -dUseCIEColor
     *     Set UseCIEColor in the page device dictionary, remapping device-dependent color values through a Postscript
     *     defined CIE color space. Document DeviceGray, DeviceRGB and DeviceCMYK source colors will be substituted
     *     respectively by Postscript CIEA, CIEABC and CIEDEFG color spaces. See the document GS9 Color Management for
     *     details on how this option will interact with Ghostscript's ICC-based color workflow. If accurate colors are
     *     desired, it is recommended that an ICC workflow be used.
     *
     * -dNOCIE
     *     Substitutes DeviceGray for CIEBasedA, DeviceRGB for CIEBasedABC and CIEBasedDEF spaces and DeviceCMYK fpr
     *     CIEBasedDEFG color spaces. Useful only on very slow systems where color accuracy is less important.
     *
     * -dNOSUBSTDEVICECOLORS
     *     This switch prevents the substitution of the ColorSpace resources (DefaultGray, DefaultRGB, and DefaultCMYK)
     *     for the DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK color spaces. This switch is primarily useful for PDF creation
     *     using the pdfwrite device when retaining the color spaces from the original document is important.
     *
     * -dNOPSICC
     *     Disables the automatic loading and use of an input color space that is contained in a PostScript file as DSC
     *     comments starting with the %%BeginICCProfile: comment. ICC profiles are sometimes embedded by applications
     *     to convey the exact input color space allowing better color fidelity. Since the embedded ICC profiles often
     *     use multidimensional RenderTables, color conversion may be slower than using the Default color conversion
     *     invoked when the -dUseCIEColor option is specified, therefore the -dNOPSICC option may result in improved
     *     performance at slightly reduced color fidelity.
     *
     * -dNOINTERPOLATE
     *     Turns off image interpolation, improving performance on interpolated images at the expense of image quality.
     *     -dNOINTERPOLATE overrides -dDOINTERPOLATE.
     *
     * -dNOTRANSPARENCY
     *     Turns off PDF 1.4 transparency, resulting in faster (but possibly incorrect) rendering of pages containing
     *     PDF 1.4 transparency and blending.
     *
     * -dNO_TN5044
     *     Turns off the TN 5044 psuedo operators. These psuedo operators are not a part of the official Postscript
     *     specification. However they are defined in Technical Note #5044 Color Separation Conventions for PostScript
     *     Language Programs. These psuedo operators are required for some files from QuarkXPress. However some files
     *     from Corel 9 and Illustrator 88 do not operate properly if these operators are present.
     *
     * -dDOPS
     *     Enables processing of DoPS directives in PDF files. DoPS has in fact been deprecated for some time. Use of
     *     this option is not recommended in security-conscious applications, as it increases the scope for malicious
     *     code. -dDOPS has no effect on processing of PostScript source files. Note: in releases 7.30 and earlier,
     *     processing of DoPS was always enabled.
