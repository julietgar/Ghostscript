     *
     * Input control
     *
     * @filename
     *     Causes Ghostscript to read filename and treat its contents the same as the command line. (This was intended
     *     primarily for getting around DOS's 128-character limit on the length of a command line.) Switches or file
     *     names in the file may be separated by any amount of white space (space, tab, line break); there is no limit
     *     on the size of the file.
     *
     * -- filename arg1 ...
     * -+ filename arg1 ...
     *     Takes the next argument as a file name as usual, but takes all remaining arguments (even if they have the
     *     syntactic form of switches) and defines the name ARGUMENTS in userdict (not systemdict) as an array of those
     *     strings, before running the file. When Ghostscript finishes executing the file, it exits back to the shell.
     *
     * -@ filename arg1 ...
     *     Does the same thing as -- and -+, but expands @filename arguments.
     *
     * -
     * -_
     *     These are not really switches: they tell Ghostscript to read from standard input, which is coming from a
     *     file
     *     or a pipe, with or without buffering. On some systems, Ghostscript may read the input one character at a
     *     time, which is useful for programs such as ghostview that generate input for Ghostscript dynamically and
     *     watch for some response, but can slow processing. If performance is significantly slower than with a named
     *     file, try '-_' which always reads the input in blocks. However, '-' is equivalent on most systems.
     *
     * -c token ...
     * -c string ...
     *     Interprets arguments as PostScript code up to the next argument that begins with "-" followed by a
     *     non-digit,
     *     or with "@". For example, if the file quit.ps contains just the word "quit", then -c quit on the command
     *     line
     *     is equivalent to quit.ps there. Each argument must be valid PostScript, either individual tokens as defined
     *     by the token operator, or a string containing valid PostScript.
     *
     * -f
     *     Interprets following non-switch arguments as file names to be executed using the normal run command. Since
     *     this is the default behavior, -f is useful only for terminating the list of tokens for the -c switch.
     *
     * -ffilename
     *     Execute the given file, even if its name begins with a "-" or "@".
     *
     * File searching
     *
     * Note that by "library files" here we mean all the files identified using the search rule under "How Ghostscript
     * finds files" above: Ghostscript's own initialization files, fonts, and files named on the command line.
     *
     * -Idirectories
     * -I directories
     *     Adds the designated list of directories at the head of the search path for library files.
     *
     * -P
     *     Makes Ghostscript look first in the current directory for library files.
     *
     * -P-
     *     Makes Ghostscript not look first in the current directory for library files (unless, of course, the first
     *     explicitly supplied directory is "."). This is now the default.
     *
     * Setting parameters
     *
     * -Dname
     * -dname
     *     Define a name in systemdict with value=true.
     *
     * -Dname=token
     * -dname=token
     *     Define a name in systemdict with the given value. The value must be a valid PostScript token (as defined by
     *     the token operator). If the token is a non-literal name, it must be true, false, or null. It is recommeded
     *     that this is used only for simple values -- use -c (above) for complex values such as procedures, arrays or
     *     dictionaries. Note that these values are defined before other names in systemdict, so any name that that
     *     conflicts with one usually in systemdict will be replaced by the normal definition during the interpreter
     *     initialization.
     *
     * -Sname=string
     * -sname=string
     *     Define a name in systemdict with a given string as value. This is different from -d. For example, -dXYZ=35
     *     on
     *     the command line is equivalent to the program fragment
     *
     *         /XYZ 35 def
     *
     *     whereas -sXYZ=35 is equivalent to
     *
     *         /XYZ (35) def
     *
     * -uname
     *     Un-define a name, cancelling -d or -s.
     *
     * Note that the initialization file gs_init.ps makes systemdict read-only, so the values of names defined with -D,
     * -d, -S, and -s cannot be changed -- although, of course, they can be superseded by definitions in userdict or
     * other dictionaries. However, device parameters set this way (PageSize, Margins, etc.) are not read-only, and can
     * be changed by code in PostScript files.
     *
     * -gnumber1xnumber2
     *     Equivalent to -dDEVICEWIDTH=number1 and -dDEVICEHEIGHT=number2, specifying the device width and height in
     *     pixels for the benefit of devices such as X11 windows and VESA displays that require (or allow) you to
     *     specify width and height. Note that this causes documents of other sizes to be clipped, not scaled: see
     *     -dFIXEDMEDIA below.
     *
     * -rnumber (same as -rnumberxnumber)
     * -rnumber1xnumber2
     *     Equivalent to -dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=number1 and -dDEVICEYRESOLUTION=number2, specifying the device horizontal
     *     and vertical resolution in pixels per inch for the benefit of devices such as printers that support multiple
     *     X and Y resolutions.
